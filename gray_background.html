<p class="readstyle">This was his healthy state and it made him cheerful, pleasant, and very attractive to intelligent men and to all women.

would join the dimmer stars in a nebulous, indeterminate heaven half-way between death and immortality. Until the time came for this 
effort he would be Anthony Patch - not a portrait of a man but a distinct and dynamic personality, opinionated, contemptuous, functioning 
from within outward - a man who was aware that there could be no honor and yet had honor, who knew the sophistry of courage and yet was brave.</p>
